              Time trials are held every Tuesday evening at 17:45, throughout
              summer and winter. Time Trials are an excellent training tool to
              gauge your level of fitness.
              <br /> <br />
              Non-RAC members are welcome. Runners can choose between the 5km
              and 8km route, and walkers can walk a 4km or 7km route.
              <br /> <br />
              After time trials, runners usually get together for a light meal
              and a few drinks at the caf√© at the clubhouse, which brings a nice
              social element to the club.
              <br /> <br />
              Tuesdays are also our club admin evening, for taking on new
              members, answering queries or issuing licenses. In the months
              leading up to Comrades, we host informative talks and interactive
              sessions for runners, sharing advice, tips and trends with
              experienced runners and novices
